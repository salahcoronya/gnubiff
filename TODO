Version 2.1.x:
--------------

To do:

- Uniformize functions comments (I really liked your way of commenting
  functions Robert so I will try to do that for remaining sources)
- Cleanup Mailbox::parse()
- Cleanup Options::update_gui()
- Fix bugs ;-)
- Make gnubiff 64bit safe (see debian bug #301853 report by David Mosberger)

Version 2.2.0:
--------------

* GtkAboutDialog (needs Gtk 2.6)
* Summary instead of immediate notification
* New option/Change behavior? If only one/some message files cannot be opened
  or read (mh/maildir), no mailbox error is shown. This way new messages can
  be missed without notification.
* Make error handling when reading/parsing mail more consistent. At the moment
  sometimes no warning is printed, always a warning is printed or a warning is
  printed in debug mode. Perhabs (new option?) print the error message in the
  tooltip?
