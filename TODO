Version 2.1.x:
--------------

To do:

- Uniformize functions comments (I really liked your way of commenting
  functions Robert so I will try to do that for remaining sources)
- Cleanup Mailbox::parse()
- Cleanup Options::update_gui()
- Fix bugs ;-)
- Obtaining mails in Popup::update() should be thread safe

Version 2.2.0:
--------------

* GtkAboutDialog (needs Gtk 2.6 and glade 2.10)
* Summary instead of immediate notification (see RFE on sourceforge)
* Make error handling when reading/parsing mail more consistent. At the moment
  sometimes no warning is printed, always a warning is printed or a warning is
  printed in debug mode. Perhabs (new option?) print the error message in the
  tooltip? (this could be done by giving the message as parameters to the
  exceptions)
* Shall some options removed from the GUI, added to the GUI (e.g. imap idling)
