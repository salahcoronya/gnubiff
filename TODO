Version 2.1.0:
--------------

To do:

- Double check the autodetect feature
- Uniformize functions comments (I really liked your way of commenting
  functions Robert so I will try to do that for remaining sources)
- Displayed last headers (instead of first) in popup when there are too many messages


Done:
- Put credits back
- Update Developpers/Maintainers in the credits panel
- Check FAM availability within configure.ac
- Implement the poll feature if no FAM available:
x  When no kernel monitor is running, fam implements the poll feature
