gnubiff is part of the GNU project, released under the aegis of GNU.
@sp 1
gnubiff is a mail notification program that checks for mail, displays
headers when new mail has arrived and allow to read first lines of new
mails. It relies on the GNOME and GTK libraries but can be compiled and
used with or without GNOME support. Supported protocols are pop3, apop,
imap4, mh, qmail and mailfile.  Furthermore, gnubiff is fully
configurable with a lot of options like polltime, poptime, sounds, mail
reader, mailbox names, etc. and can also filter spam.@* Note that
gnubiff is not a mail reader even if it offers the possibility of
reading very first lines of new mails. If you send some requests for
specific features to be implemented, keep that in mind !

After installation, you should be able to select gnubiff in the Internet
menu of the GNOME panel. Be careful that after installation, panel has
to be restarted if this is your first installation. If gnubiff doesn't
appear, check that prefix you provided at configure time is correct

gnubiff doesn't appear in GNOME panel menu, please contact the author.

@node Animation format
@chapter Animation format
@unnumberedsec
@comment ------------------------------------------------------------
gnubiff uses a very simple PNG animation format that allow to use full
color images and also to handle alpha channel properly (thanks to PNG
support). The idea is simply to put all frames of your animation in one
big PNG image and gnubiff will take care of the animation. But, gnubiff
cannot decide what is the size of a frame based on image size and so
you have to provide this size with the name of the image. The convention
is that frame size is given between parenthesis.@* 
For example, "anim(64x64).png" means that frame size is 64 by 64
pixels and then image should be n*64 pixels wide and 64 pixels tall
(where n is the number of frame).
@sp 1
@noindent To convert a gif animation to this format just type:@*
@command{convert +append animation.gif animation(64x64).png}
